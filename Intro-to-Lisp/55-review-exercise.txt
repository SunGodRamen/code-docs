This exercise will challenge you to use all of the concepts covered in the
syllabus up to chapter 5, including metaprogramming, functional programming,
object-oriented programming, and lists. It will also allow you to develop your
skills in generating and manipulating code at runtime, and using Lisp's
advanced features to create powerful and flexible programs.

Write a Lisp program that generates a class hierarchy for mathematical
expressions, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The
program should allow expressions to be constructed and evaluated at runtime
using a combination of functional and object-oriented programming techniques.
Here are the specific requirements:

   1) Define a base class called expression with methods for evaluating the
expression and converting it to a string representation.

   2) Define subclasses for each mathematical operation (addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division) that inherit from expression. Each subclass
should define methods for evaluating the operation and converting it to a
string representation.

   3) Use macros to generate classes and methods at compile-time based on a list of
expressions provided at runtime. The program should be able to dynamically
generate new expression classes based on the input list.

   4) Use functional programming techniques to allow expressions to be constructed
and evaluated at runtime using higher-order functions and closures. The program
should be able to construct complex expressions by combining simple expressions
using functions like map, reduce, and filter.

   5) Use object-oriented programming techniques to allow expressions to be
manipulated and optimized at runtime using polymorphism and inheritance. The
program should be able to optimize expressions by simplifying them using
algebraic identities and other mathematical rules.
