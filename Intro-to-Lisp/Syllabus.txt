Course Title: Lisp Programming Language

Course Description: This course will provide an in-depth study of the Lisp programming language, covering its history, syntax, data structures, programming paradigms, and advanced features. Students will learn how to write Lisp programs, use the REPL, and work with a variety of libraries and tools.

Prerequisites: CS106B or equivalent programming experience in a language such as Python, Java, or C++. Familiarity with functional programming concepts is recommended but not required.
