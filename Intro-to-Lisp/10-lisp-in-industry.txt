Lisp has a long history of being used in various industries, including but not
limited to artificial intelligence, finance, gaming, and aerospace. Some
notable companies that use Lisp include Google, NASA, and Jane Street.

Google has been using Lisp since the company's inception, starting with the
development of the company's web crawler, which was implemented in Common Lisp.
Google has also developed and released several open source Lisp libraries,
including Google Closure, a JavaScript library that includes a Lisp-style
syntax for macros.

NASA has used Lisp in various projects, including the development of software
for space exploration, such as the Mars Rover mission. Lisp's ability to handle
complex mathematical calculations and algorithms made it an ideal choice for
these types of projects.

Jane Street, a quantitative trading firm, heavily uses Lisp in its trading
infrastructure. Lisp's powerful macros and functional programming capabilities
make it well-suited for this type of work.

Demand for Lisp programmers is relatively low compared to other programming
languages, but there are still opportunities available, particularly in the
industries mentioned above. The salary for Lisp programmers varies depending on
location, company, and experience, but it is generally competitive with other
software development positions.

Companies hiring Lisp developers typically look for candidates with a strong
background in functional programming, as well as experience with Lisp-specific
libraries and tools. Knowledge of other programming languages and technologies
is also important, as Lisp is often used in conjunction with other languages
and technologies in real-world applications.

If a developer enjoys using Lisp but wants to find a similar language with
higher demand and potentially higher salaries, they might consider studying
Clojure. Clojure is a modern Lisp dialect that runs on the Java Virtual Machine
and has gained popularity in recent years for its ability to easily
interoperate with Java libraries and frameworks. It has a growing community and
is used by companies such as Amazon, Walmart, and Puppet Labs. Clojure also has
a similar functional programming paradigm to Lisp, so many of the skills
learned in Lisp will transfer over to Clojure.

That being said, it will be said to you that Lisp can been used in a variety of
industries, including aerospace, finance, and technology. Some well-known
companies that have used Lisp include Google, NASA, and ITA Software (now part
of Google). Lisp is valued for its ability to handle complex data structures
and provide powerful abstractions, making it well-suited for applications such
as AI, machine learning, and natural language processing.

If you are just a code geek, then you are in luck. Lisp has a long standing
community. The Lisp community is known for its collaborative spirit and focus
on open-source software development. The community is passionate about
developing and promoting the use of Lisp and related technologies.

One of the main forums used by the Lisp community is the Common Lisp Wiki,
which provides a platform for sharing information and resources related to
Common Lisp development. The community also maintains several mailing lists,
including the lisp-hug mailing list, which is used for general discussion about
Lisp and related topics, and the comp.lang.lisp newsgroup.

Contributing to the Lisp community can take many forms, including participating
in discussions on mailing lists and forums, submitting bug reports and patches
to open-source Lisp projects, and contributing to the development of new
libraries and tools. The community values collaboration, creativity, and a
commitment to open-source software development.

In addition to contributing to open-source projects, Lisp developers can also
participate in community events such as Lisp conferences and hackathons. These
events provide opportunities for developers to network with other Lisp
programmers, share ideas, and learn about the latest developments in Lisp
technology.

Overall, the Lisp community is an inclusive and welcoming group that values
collaboration and innovation. By contributing to the community, Lisp developers
can help to promote the use of Lisp and ensure that it continues to be a
vibrant and dynamic language for years to come.
